    "# Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Because python provides a simple interface to relay information, it's easy to use, easy to setup pipelines and integrations, it's not sandboxed, it's repeatable and explicit, and many of the tools we rely on were developed alongside modern tools similar to it or actually with it, and due to that, a large portion of the work is already done. I am not a good python instructor, [this guy is,](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms) watch his videos to learn HOW to use python, this is WHY to use python. [Harvard CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbT7vzCvEc8) is also a good resource for general computer science. Paid boot camps or courses generally offer little additional benefit to the previous two resources beyond the pressure to attend due to investment, certificates, and networking with industry recruiters upon completion.\n",

    "Not for most of these tasks as you'll see, it's too sandboxed. It's constrained to the functions that Microsoft allows it to do, which often don't allow for direct manipulation of certain external file or data types and/or certain remote connections and functions. I assume it's extensible, but I hate writing stuff in it, so if anyone could get this stuff working in it I'd happily swap for it$^1$, but I legitimately don't believe it's entirely possible, an efficient use of resources, or that the individual willing to attempt it exists within the organization. Sandboxing standard users who may damage a system is a good thing, sandboxing integration tooling, APIs and power users is a bad thing.\n",

    "I don't personally know it, I have Java experience because I ran scripts on video games with it as a kid and wrote some android apps. I don't know if the GIS, geospatial and engineering libraries are available for it, like I know they are in python, which is heavily used in academic research. From what I've read and understand, it's not as cross-platform or web friendly, and it's difficult to train engineering employees on C style coding, memory management and pointers, none of which are needed to effectively 'use' python. I would be willing to learn it, but I don't think the organization would be willing to expend the resources to enable that or that it would significantly change any outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know the general consensus I've seen online, [as well as my personal experience](https://daneparks.com), is that it's much simpler to design and publicly host a webapp using other open source solutions (ruby-on-rails, Nginx, Go, and JS), than it is to compile a functional application into Microsoft's ecosystem which is complex. Most importantly, throughout my learning experience, python leaning open-source communities have shown to be much more focused on making high quality, free training available to people trying to learn new tools while most .NET courses required payment, which isn't an option for people looking to explore \"potential\" avenues that might not work out and I think is a bad indicator for the community. I firmly believe the most valuable aspect of python is the number of people who have tried to learn it and it's resulting ability to be learned quickly with a combination of google and [especially youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+course&sp=CAM%253D).\n",

    "The main issue you run into is compatibility. Launching a dedicated app with a fully fleshed out accessible, cross-platform compatible interface requires a decent understanding of your user devices, and use cases, so that you can tailor your code to only features available on your user's devices. If instead you write your applications and libraries with a specific server environment in mind, or basically \"device agnostic\" you don't have to worry as much about it.  You may realize this means that you could loose direct access to say, the Iphone 8 camera's API for taking photos, but a workaround for this would be making the application work with existing photos already on the device, and having the application open the photo application for the user to point it to the correct folder on the device to interact with the photos. Although a bespoke Iphone app written in swift by a professional team of apple developers would obviously be better than anything I could write, I haven't seen those getting created at any of the organizations I've been a part of, and I can't see the result being cost effective or well-integrated. I can personally provide a (relatively) cross-platform solution to a number of issues with python today."

    "#### So Why Server Side Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern server and database software is insanely powerful, in the server world the open-source packages are legitimately superior for many applications, with the advent of IoT, linux based servers like Ubuntu or RHEL have exploded in popularity due to users being able to throw them on any device without worrying about license management. Tiny core linux is 11 MB total, the entire operating system is 11 MB, you could put it on a microusb and integrate it into a streetlamp. Obviously simplicity generally comes with reduced features, but one of the features most if not all do come with is python, further the \"import only what you need\" mentality ensures these systems always run efficiently, and are rarely bogged down. Due to this, certain sectors have organically grown to basically depend on certain python libraries and other open source packages. This isn't without it's headaches, but it's better than not defining a standard at all. GIS, Data Science and Robotics all have very developed python libraries written by skilled professionals from that space that learned how to program. Nothing is stopping roadway, structural or hydraulic engineering from developing the same kinds of tools today, except existing policies geared towards closed and incompatible workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Software written in python may be able to be improved or rewritten in other languages to be made to be more efficient. For now, I think it's important to get working software tools and standards created, which we could optimize later. The fact is currently, the tools don't exist at all, some not even in a disjointed way. It's easier to teach an engineer python than to teach them .NET, and it's more realistic to teach an engineer how to __USE__ python tools than to teach a .NET developer the full workflow and duties of a roadway engineer."

    "Primarily the resources available to the program, the permissions it operates under, and the APIs it has access to with regard to other software.  When you run a jupyter notebook, it boots up a server on your local computer you're able to connect to with your webbrowser as the client. This process is device agnostic and works on windows, mac and linux machines. Basically notebooks replace the view and controller in the MVC diagram, giving the user direct access to the server side model. The model can be anything, a .txt file, a .csv file, a .pdf, a database connection, a .jpg, a .dwg, a datastream or a webhook. This is what seperates python from Excel/VBA, it's ability to seamlessly function and integrate with essentially any 'model' or data type on any kind of system with little to no work on the part of the developer beyond a simple google search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the notebook server is being run on your local machine, there's no external access, an alternative to this would be to have a centralized server where individuals had their own user profiles, as well as shared folders between all users, network folders also accomplish the same purpose. Generally this can be done in a way that builds off the existing userprofiles and permissions that already exist. If each user is given an account on a centralized server, they could open the terminal and run the following command to access the server.\n",

You'll notice that I'm using long, explicit variable names that describe what the object actually contains, that's because python programmers _want_ people to read and check their code. Now that this dict has been defined once, it's very easy to copy and paste it, or import the definitions into other python software. Better yet, people familiar with the JSON standard may realize that a python dict looks pretty similar to a json file. Python contains libraries to load json files directly into memory in less lines of code than our C# hello_world from earlier.\n",

With the correct organizational controls (dedicated urls) we could have standards at dedicated locations for applications to pull the most up to date standard from. Sharepoint doesn't do this very well, every Linux and open source package repository does, usually by using `url/latest` or by keeping old revisions under different urls."

    "Ultimately the point of registering and licensing engineers through the state is to ensure accountability and traceability of the actions of the industry. Ideally each state would maintain their own \"licensing server\" that regularly updated with the other 49, that also tracked licensed professionals current status. That way, in the event of malpractice, or much more likely, the event of a self reported error, the state could deactive that individuals license by \"dropping their keys\", preventing their digital signatures from verifying, or use other software tools to determine exactly which projects are at potential risk. Pushing this responsibility to 3rd parties, allows the possibility of frequent \"digital identity changes\" for example when an engineer stamps in adobe vs. bluebeam, and opens the door to incompatible record systems."

    "## Where Are The Issues/Hangups?\n",
    "\n",
    "__3 Primary Pain Points to solve__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Approved Software Lists\"; they're difficult to maintain at a 'package' level, like impossibly difficult in open source without just blanket approving a parent package/product like \"Ubuntu\", which would implicity approve any dependency it's built on in perpetuity? Most organizational software policies contain confusing language like this, at least to me, it doesn't feel like these standards were written with the more modern modular tooling and software packages available today particularly in mind, it's written in regards to full, packaged applications which is an entirely different realm. \n",
    "\n",
    "    To alleviate some of the risk with this, open-source systems are generally designed to be more \"ephemeral\" and segmented. Some examples of this, with a large amount of popularity are \"container\" systems like Docker or Kubernetes. These systems rely on extensive API's which they try to keep as consistent as possible, as the products are changed and updated they're kept on release schedules and generally come with fantastic documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of organizational standards pertaining to file systems; no matter what system environment, programming language, or software package we're talking about, certain general conventions apply.  Microsoft has traditionally been more willing to accomodate a wide variaty of file system hierarchies and in general, the ones I see are heavily catered to human use, and by extension very poorly designed for scripting or bots. Working in windows environments has historically inspired certain conventions, some of which I think are mostly still around as vestigial structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Things like encoding documents with 15 digit numbers are ridiculous, nested file systems generated by a bot where 60% of the folders are never used are pervasive in our industry. Bad metadata, nothing checking it, inconsistent file names and folder locations due to human error. If you were to hand a professional programmer 90% of the file systems I've encountered on a drive they'd triple their hourly rate on the spot. We can't feign ignorance and act like it's not our mess as an industry to clean up. These are more often than not records and documents of critical structures, that with little effort could be preserved indefinately. I have zero faith that our industry across the board isn't destroying hundreds of gigabytes of unrecoverable, important data every day via poorly implemented content managment systems, entirely accidentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Not understanding the foundational principles of the tools we use every day. At some point our industry seemed content to push our work onto 3rd party software providers that have frankly, done a mostly terrible job and have increasingly displayed concerning behaviors at an instituional level. At a most basic level, engineers understand economics and competition of the free market place. There are two providers for CAD software in our industry. One of them is more expensive and has a wide variety of API's and tools available that can be integrated into their products easily and is generally more pleasant to work with. The other doesn't let you import an object from one of their software packages to another (OpenRoads to OpenBridges) and is overly complicated to the point that organizations struggle to maintain effective drafting evironments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Further on this point, the existance of all of our drafting/design data as .dgn, .dwg or other proprietary file formats presents an issue with archival records. CADD files are proprietary and can only be read by the system that created them. Many CADD files can't be read by earlier versions of __THE SAME SOFTWARE THAT CREATED THEM__ these companies are clearly making an attempt at \"locking\" their clients into their systems and subscription based services, which I've seen little to no pushback to from the general industry. I fully believe their attempts at locking in their clients have gotten to the point that it's clear we need to start making real effort towards dumping files into plain text formats, or at the very least a filesystem backup we have control over.\n",
    "\n",
    "People may push back and say \"Well what legitimate alternatives are available?\" and there aren't any. I'm not telling you to stop using Autodesk or Bentley products at all, I'm especially not telling you to stop using filesystems or Windows or learn git and try to replace projectwise with it. What I'm saying, is that if you look into open source software, specifically [The unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#:~:text=The%20Unix%20philosophy%20emphasizes%20building,as%20opposed%20to%20monolithic%20design.), and by extension the design philosphies of the various open-source packages they inspired. You'll see that it's really much more about keeping everything simple, and setting easily implementable standards that can be checked for at a glance and easily referenced. Better yet, they already set out and defined most of these general principles for complicated systems, and told us we can take them, so really all any modern engineer has to do is read them once and keep them in mind. This is a critical aspect to being an informed software consumer and really understanding what we're paying for, and what sacrifices we're making to use certain products."
