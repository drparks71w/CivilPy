"""Shared Rhino layer taxonomy for civilpy's ``.3dm`` writers.

Every civilpy module that writes a ``.3dm`` (``rhino_gdr``, ``rhino_deck``,
``rhino_barrier``, ``rhino_box_beam``, and the ODOT SCD Grasshopper
components) should bake into these layers instead of inventing its own
flat names, so a file civilpy writes and the C# ``RhinoODOTExtension``
plugin reads (or vice versa) resolve to the *same* nested layer instead of
silently duplicating it under a differently-spelled one.

**Deck / Superstructure / Substructure are authoritative and pinned to the
C# side** -- transcribed byte-for-byte from
``ODOT Rhino Plugin/Core/Gdr.cs`` (``RhinoODOTExtension`` repo,
commit ``34f7051``, "GirderDeck command + Deck/Superstructure/Substructure
layer groups"). This mirrors NBIS/SNBI's three inspection groups (deck,
superstructure, substructure condition ratings), so the layer tree reads
the way a bridge is actually inspected and the same grouping can carry
straight through to Midas/BrR/AssetWise/IFC element groups later --
that alignment is the point of a shared layer taxonomy, not an
afterthought.

**Culvert and Site are civilpy-side PROPOSED additions** (not yet in
``Gdr.cs``) for the ODOT SCD standard-drawing components that are neither
deck, superstructure, nor substructure: headwalls/box culverts (Culvert)
and off-structure roadway items like approach slabs, portable barrier, and
drainage strips (Site). See the dated "PROPOSED" section in
``docs/Rhino Design Philosophy.md`` for the reconciliation request; do not
treat these two as frozen until the C# side signs off, same as every other
``gdr.*`` contract addition.
