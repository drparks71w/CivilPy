"""A riveted built-up member as the pieces a shop actually made.

:mod:`civilpy.structural.builtup` turns a plan-sheet spec into the
rectangles of its *bare* section -- web plates, angle legs, cover plates.
That is the section a designer sized, and it is what a stress sheet records.
It is not the member.  The member is that section **plus the lacing that
holds the two webs together, the tie plates that close its ends, and the
rivets through all of it**, and on a truss of this era that additional steel
is not a rounding error: the 2012 rating of CUY-10-1613 carries a per-member
multiplier on the bare section of 1.06-2.87, median 1.87, covering "lacing,
batten/tie plates, gussets, rivets".

Drawing only the bare section is therefore LOD 300 however finely it is
decomposed -- the fabricated assembly is not represented and cannot be
queried.  This module is the LOD 400 model: every piece is an object with a
size, a length, a position in the member, a catalogue designation where it
has one, and a weight.

Where the values come from
--------------------------
Everything here is meant to be read off the fabrication drawings, and each
value carries a ``source`` saying which.  For CUY-10-1613 (Mt. Vernon Bridge
Co. contract 5643, Wilbur Watson & F. R. Walker, Sept 1930) the shop
``L``-series sheets give a bill per member, e.g. for U11-U12 of span 3::

    2P - 24 x 3/8 x 23-11 1/2        web plates
    4L - 4x4x3/8 x 23-11 1/2         corner angles
    1P - 21 x ... x 3-10             tie plate
    1P - 48 x ... x 3-10             tie plate
    D.L. 2 1/2 x 1/4 ...             double lacing bars

and the title block gives ``RIVETS 1" DIA EXCEPT AS NOTED, HOLES PUNCHED
1 1/8``.  A value that could not be read off a sheet is recorded with a
``source`` that says so, so the model never silently passes off a default as
an as-built dimension.

Angles are matched to the AISC shapes table for their catalogue designation.
Their *area* needs no correction: the sharp-cornered decomposition
``builtup.rects`` uses -- full outstanding leg plus the remaining web leg --
reproduces the catalogue area exactly (L4x4x1/2: 4x0.5 + 3.5x0.5 = 3.75 in^2,
and the table says 3.75), because the fillet and the toe radii very nearly
cancel. What the catalogue adds is the identity and the centroid.
