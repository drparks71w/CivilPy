"""AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation (MBE) Section 6A — LRFR load rating.

The general rating equation composes any of the capacity checks in this
package into a load rating:

    RF = (C - gamma_DC*DC - gamma_DW*DW +/- gamma_P*P) / (gamma_LL*(LL+IM))

where C = phi_c * phi_s * phi * Rn at strength limit states (with
phi_c*phi_s >= 0.85) or the allowable stress fR at service limit states.

Factors default to the published MBE values but every one is overridable —
agencies routinely customize them.
Consistent force/moment units in = same units out; RF is dimensionless.
