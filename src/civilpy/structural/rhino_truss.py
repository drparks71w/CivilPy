"""BrIM emit for a riveted steel truss -- the source-of-truth 3-D model.

:mod:`civilpy.structural.rhino_bim` does this for the parametric plate-girder
bridge; this is its twin for the trusses that make up most of the old long
spans, where there is no parametric layout to generate from -- the geometry
comes off the erection and member sheets, panel point by panel point.

The model is *as-built*, not schematic.  A truss member of the riveted era
is a bundle of flat plates and angles, and at LOD 400 that is exactly what
is drawn: :mod:`civilpy.structural.builtup` decomposes the plan-sheet
shorthand (``"2P24x9/16 4L6x4x3/8"``) into its web plates, its four corner
angles and its cover plates, and each becomes its own solid on the member's
axis.  At LOD 300 the member collapses to the single box that envelopes it,
which is what a whole-bridge file wants.  Gusset plates are real plates:
the outline traced off the failure-plane sheets, extruded at the measured
thickness, sitting on the faces of the member webs at the joint -- with
their rating write-back on board, so a viewer can pick any plate in the
bridge and read what governs it.

Everything is stamped with :mod:`civilpy.structural.bim` tags
(``bim.type``/``bim.id``, a ``pay.*`` block, a ``mat.*`` block carrying the
MBE historic-steel yield and tensile), so the same file drives the model
tree, the quantity takeoff and the estimator hand-off that the girder
pipeline already feeds.

Coordinates are **feet** (the hub convention): X along the bridge, Y
transverse, Z elevation.  Section dimensions in the tags stay in inches.

Member orientation
------------------
A truss member's webs are parallel to the plane of its truss, so the
section's local axes follow from the member axis and the truss plane
normal:

* local **u** -- along the member, node i to node j
* local **y** -- across the width (web to web), the truss plane normal,
  i.e. bridge-transverse for a truss in a vertical plane
* local **z** -- through the depth, in the truss plane, perpendicular to
  the member

which is the same y/z that :mod:`civilpy.structural.builtup` uses, so a
section rectangle maps straight onto the member with no extra convention.

Backends
--------
:func:`truss_emit` returns the same neutral ``EmitObject`` records
``rhino_bim`` uses, so both of its backends work unchanged:
:func:`~civilpy.structural.rhino_bim.objects_to_3dm` bakes a ``.3dm`` with
standalone ``rhino3dm`` (use ``mesh=True`` for a file the web viewer can
shade), and the live-document driver consumes the same JSON.

    """Build a gusset outline from the members it connects.

    The shape of a gusset is not a free choice and it is not something to
    trace off a drawing: it follows from the members.  Each member end needs
    the plate to reach its **full depth**, and the plate is cut **square to
    that member's own axis** just beyond its last row of fasteners.  Between
    one member's connection and the next the plate runs a **straight slope**
    from corner to corner.  A chord passing through the joint is not cut off
    at all -- the plate simply follows it.

    So each member contributes two corners::

        corner = work_point + (connection + edge) * axis  +/-  depth/2 * normal

    and the outline is those corners taken in angular order about the work
    point.  The square end-cut is the segment between a member's own two
    corners; the slope is the segment between adjacent members' corners.
    Where the members all leave on one side -- an end joint -- the work point
    closes the shape.

    ``edge_in`` is the edge distance carried beyond the connection.

    The result is the convex hull of those corners together with the work
    point -- see the body for why the hull is the right closure and not
    merely a convenience.

    ``fasteners``, if given as the plate's rivet field in plate coordinates,
    also sizes the plate to the field: a 1932 plate edge sits an edge
    distance beyond the outermost fastener, so the field's own hull pushed
    out by ``edge_in`` is a lower bound on the plate.  It matters because the
    reach only sees the rivets inside a member's own depth, and a real
    fastener field spreads wider than that -- without it the outline leaves a
    median 13% of the rivets off the plate, which no gusset does.

    ``bounds``, if given as ``(x0, y0, x1, y1)``, clips the result to the
    plate's overall size.  The rule places each corner where its member needs
    it, which at a tight joint can put a corner past the edge of the plate the
    shop actually cut; the overall width and depth are tabulated in the rating
    and are the one plate dimension that is independently confirmed, so
    clipping to them keeps the shape inside what is known to be true.

    Returns the polygon in plate coordinates (inches), counter-clockwise.
